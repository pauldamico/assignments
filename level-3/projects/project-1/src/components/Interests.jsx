      <p>
        I enjoy coding everyday, working out, and spending time with my Fianc√©
        and dog. I am constantly coding everyday and find it very enjoyable. To
        keep my from burning out and staying healthy, I do CrossFit 6 days a
        week. It is the perfect mix and allows me to get up and out once in a
        while.
